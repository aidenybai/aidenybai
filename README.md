<summary>Two years ago, I started <a href="https://millionjs.org"><strong>✦ Million.js</strong></a> as a small experiment to make the Virtual DOM faster.<br /><br /><b><em>↪️ (click to open)</em></b></summary>

<br />

Today, it's grown to over **7,100+ stars, 140+ projects, and 160,000+ installs**. I get messages and DM's every day of people expressing their excitement about Million.js—an excitement I deeply share.

**For two years, I've lived and breathed Million.js**.

I'm my best self as an open-source maintainer—that bug-slashing, issue-closing, PR-wielding maintainer. Whether it be tinkering with benchmarks late into the twilight hours or frantically pushing a hotfix inside my school's bathroom stall, **I f-ing love the thrill of knowing I've been able to help other developers**.

Because at my heart, I'm still that same 15 y/o that fell in love with open source—a superpower that allowed me to create and share my ideas with the world.

Being at an early stage where every minute spent on the project can make a significant difference, I often find myself juggling my time between school, my part-time job, and open-source development (_I currently sleep <4 hours per day_). It's a constant battle, with each day more overwhelming and sleepless to the next.

There are moments when I feel overwhelmed by the weight of my responsibilities, when I question my ability to keep up with the demands of my personal life and the project. But each time, my passion for Million.js and the open-source community brings me back on track, reminding me of why I chose this path in the first place.

**I need your help.**

Any monetary contribution would be critical in allowing me to push Million.js forward. **My goal is to work full-time for the next 4 months** at the USA minimum wage of $7.25/hour in order to reach Million.js to maturity.

**Together, let's move towards a faster web ◕ ◡ ◕ っ**
